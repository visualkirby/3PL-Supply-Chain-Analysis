# SCMS Delivery Reliability & Cost Analysis

## 1️⃣ Shipment mode is the primary driver of delivery reliability
- Air shipments achieve the highest on-time performance (>90%) but at a significantly higher cost per unit.
- Ocean shipments are the least reliable and frequently arrive late, though they represent a small share of total volume.
- Truck shipments sit between air and ocean on both cost and reliability, making them the most actionable mode for intervention.

## 2️⃣ Reliability improvements show diminishing returns at higher cost levels
- Higher transportation spend is associated with improved reliability, but the gains are not proportional.
- Air freight provides marginal reliability improvements relative to its significantly higher unit cost.
- Truck shipments offer a more balanced cost–reliability profile for non–time-critical deliveries.

## 3️⃣ Vendor performance risk is concentrated, not systemic
- A small number of vendors—particularly those supporting RDC-managed and truck shipments—account for a disproportionate share of late or early deliveries.
- Performance variation suggests operational or capacity constraints rather than network-wide failure.

## 4️⃣ Geographic delivery risk is concentrated in high-volume African corridors
- Several Sub-Saharan African countries combine high shipment volume with below-average on-time performance.
- These regions also show limited vendor diversity for truck shipments.

## 5️⃣ Early deliveries can be as disruptive as late deliveries
- Shipments arrive an average of several days earlier than scheduled.
- Significant early delivery may introduce coordination challenges and reduce confidence in delivery estimates, depending on SLA terms.
